# Confident Ruby

This repository contains my interactive notes from the [Confident Ruby book by Avdi Grim](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15847933-confident-ruby).

---

Topics to investigate in more depth:
- splat operator
- Proc
- class methods (const_get)
- dollar sign ($stdout)
- formatting (%1.3f, %w)
- nokogiri module
- method definition with star (def some_method(*))
- & operator for method blocks (def some_method(a, b, &block))
- & operator with symbol as method reference (.map(&:chomp))
